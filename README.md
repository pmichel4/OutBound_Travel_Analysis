# Travel Agency Analysis

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of imaginary travel data created using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes various parameters related to travel plans, including types of 
travelers, costs, and cities visited. The data is entirely fictional, ensuring that no real personal information is shared.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to improve my skills in Microsoft Excel, particularly in data analysis and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate my 
ability to manipulate data effectively, apply various Excel functions, and create insightful visualizations to convey key findings.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Utilized Excel functions such as `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `COUNTIF`, `SUMIF` and `VLOOKUP` to analyze travel costs, patterns based on traveler types, and
- other demographics.
- **Data Visualization**: Created tables and graphs in the Infographics worksheet to visually represent data insights and comparisons between metrics.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Leveraged the Power Query Editor to clean and transform the data for better suitability in analysis.
- **Unique Identification**: Developed methods to identify unique entries in the dataset, enhancing data integrity and usability.

## Key Insights

- **Difference between Median and Average**: The analysis revealed a difference of a few hundred dollars between the median and average costs, with the median being lower. This may
- indicate that a small number of high-cost outliers are affecting the average, highlighting the importance of considering both metrics in financial analysis.
- **Client Demographics and Marketing Opportunities**: The home states of clients in the U.S. were less diverse than anticipated. This suggests that increased marketing efforts in
- areas with a higher concentration of clients could yield more business.
- **Targeting Older Adults**: Analysis of client demographics indicated potential growth opportunities in marketing to adults aged 50-59 and 60+. For instance, targeting retirement
- celebration trips could tap into this market segment effectively.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to create a live table in Power BI to ensure that the information is constantly updated, allowing for real-time insights and more dynamic reporting.

## Installation

To view or edit the Excel file:

1. Clone this repository or download the Excel file.
2. Open the file in Microsoft Excel or a compatible program (e.g., Google Sheets).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the data and utilize the provided analyses to gain insights into traveler behavior and preferences. You can modify formulas, add charts, or conduct further 
analysis as needed.

## Conclusion

This project not only showcases my analytical skills but also highlights my proficiency in using Microsoft Excel for data analysis. I hope that stakeholders in the company, as well as 
future employers, will find value in this work.
